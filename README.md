# Planit

Planit is a full stack goal setting and mindfulness (mobile first) web application that allows users to create a profile, see current planetary placements, and use those placements as a guide for setting personal goals and being mindful of how they view and interact with the world! Users can navigate to different planet pages to learn more about their influences in certain placements.
