                    <Aries height='80px' />
                    <h4>Aries</h4>
                    <p>As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries are all about fresh starts. 
                        They are active and will likely make good athletes. 
                        They’re straightforward and direct and when people do not share this trait, it confuses them. 
                        They deeply enjoy challenges and can be quite competitive. 
                        Aries Suns are sometimes impatient since they gravitate towards the quickest path for everything they do. 
                        They are also innovative pioneers in what ever they do.</p>
                    <Taurus height='80px' />
                    <h4>Taurus</h4>
                    <p>Taurus Suns are very hardworking when it comes to their jobs, but at home they are all about comfort and relaxation. 
                        They are sensual people, and enjoy indulging all of their senses whether it comes to great food, a fuzzy blanket, 
                        or just taking in all the sights and smells of nature. 
                        Taurus Suns also tend to be quite materialistic.</p>
                    <Gemini height='80px' />
                    <h4>Gemini</h4>
                    <p>Gemini Suns are all about mental stimulation. 
                        They love to collect and share information. 
                        They typically will know a small amount about many subjects rather than a vast amount on a few subjects. 
                        This is due to having a smaller attention span. They are curious, witty, and very clever. 
                        They can adapt to new situations very well, often adopting the moods of the people around them. 
                        They may have many friends and contacts, but getting close to Gemini Suns can be difficult.</p>
                    <Cancer height='80px' />
                    <h4>Cancer</h4>
                    <p>Cancer Suns are very dependable and caring. 
                        They want security and with that comes a strong sense of survival. 
                        They are more resistant to change since it may infringe on that security they hold so tightly. 
                        Cancers love to reminisce and find pleasure looking through old photos, and the like. 
                        They can be quite sensitive and will avoid direct confrontations.</p>
                    <Leo height='80px' />
                    <h4>Leo</h4>
                    <p>Leo Suns are warm and generous folk. 
                        Their happiness comes from others and they want to spread that happiness to others and the rest of the world; 
                        making it a better place. Their self image is very important and would be very hurt if accused of bad intentions. 
                        hey are very similar to their symbol, the lion, 
                        in that they can be very hardworking but also have bouts of laziness. 
                        However when Leos do get to work, that is where their inner fire bursts forth and they do their jobs with intensity.</p>
                    <Virgo height='80px' />
                    <h4>Virgo</h4>
                    <p>Virgo Suns are self sufficient and quite hardworking. 
                        They also can be reserved around new people, but once comfortable they become very talkative. 
                        Virgos also do not typically like to be the center of attention. They are very worried people. 
                        They worry about health, work, and basically life in general. 
                        They are natural perfectionists which can lead to being severely self critical. 
                        Even though many Virgos lack confidence, their work is something they are profoundly proud of. 
                        They believe their way is the best way. If Virgos feel appreciated and useful, 
                        they will return with immense amounts of kindness.</p>
                    <Libra height='80px' />
                    <h4>Libra</h4>
                    <p>Harmony is what Libra Suns are all about. 
                        They are the peace-keepers and will do what ever is necessary to keep the balance. 
                        They are sociable intellectuals, and people gravitate towards their approachable presence. 
                        Libra Suns just want life to be fair.</p>
                    <Scorpio height='80px' />
                    <h4>Scorpio</h4>
                    <p>Scorpio Suns are fiercely determined and observant. 
                        Intensity radiates from them and they will never be intimidated or back down from anything. 
                        Scorpios often experience quite a bit of trauma in their lives and are not afraid to talk about it. 
                        They can be pessimistic, but if they learn to see the lighter side of things and not expect the worst possible outcomes, 
                        they will find the power to heal and transform.</p>
                    <Sagittarius height='80px' />
                    <h4>Sagittarius</h4>
                    <p>Sagittarius Suns are generally easy-going and fun people to be around. 
                        They love and need freedom. This freedom seeking sometimes leads people to believe they are irresponsible. 
                        They love to learn and explore, and are very optimistic towards people and the world. 
                        Sagittarius is a fire sign, and like Aries, tend to have short fuse; but they forgive and forget almost just as fast.</p>
                    <Capricorn height='80px' />
                    <h4>Capricorn</h4>
                    <p>Capricorn Suns are goal-oriented with a realistic outlook on life. 
                        They are seen as very grounded and resourceful individuals. 
                        Like Virgos, Capricorns need to feel useful and appreciated, but they also want recognition. 
                        They can be lonely people but never ever let it show. 
                        They never wear their hearts on their sleeves, as it does not coincide with their practical nature. 
                        This makes Capricorns seem reserved or even standoffish. 
                        However their sense of humor makes up for this immensely. 
                        They are usually masters of sarcasm as well.</p>
                    <Aquarius height='80px' />
                    <h4>Aquarius</h4>
                    <p>Aquarius values progress, but prefers to make it their own way. 
                        Generally they are well liked, clever, and intellectual. 
                        They are surprisingly stubborn, and will not often sway their opinions. 
                        Aquarius Suns will try to get others in their lives to “not follow the crowd” 
                        and embrace what makes the person different.</p>
                    <Pisces height='80px' />
                    <h4>Pisces</h4>
                    <p>Pisces Suns are incredibly empathetic and understanding. 
                        Their minds are open to everyone and anyone from any background. 
                        They have a deep love for humanity and are not likely to cause hurt to anyone. 
                        They are sensitive to criticism and will retreat into their own dream worlds if reality seems too harsh. 
                        They tend to spend a lot of time in quiet suffering, but will use it to gain strength, understanding, and even more compassion for others. 
                        Pisces are often very creative, and express themselves in the arts.</p>
